# TODO

[ ] Find example of bigger features that were implemented by people other than Rahix.

    Is there anything I can learn from them? Obvious example: does Rahix have a
    preference for/against force pushes when updating CR?

[ ] Verify: is it okay that I've deleted ~all the interrupt code?

# Final testing

Before updating PR, verify:

* `micro-usb-serial.rs` actually works

* Run `docs`, and read the docs:

  file:///home/i/Workspaces/2/avr-hal/target/doc/atmega_hal/struct.UsbdBus.html#limit-1

* publish the docs to my fork, and share a link so that Rahix can review
