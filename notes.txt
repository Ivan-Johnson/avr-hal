Open questions:

1. Do I need `default_serial`?

   Given the lack of UART support, I would expect not. However,
   `sparkfun-promicro` doesn't support it either and yet it has a
   `default_serial`

1. Is it okay that I'm reusing `arduino-hal/src/port/leonardo.rs` for the
   Arduino Micro? In particular:

   * None of the other port files use `#[cfg(...)]`

   * There are a few IO pins that have different labels depending on where you
     look, which caused me some confusion. Using IO12 as an example:

     * [arduino_micro_schematic.pdf](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/arduino_micro_schematic.pdf): IO12

     * [Pinout-Micro_latest.png](https://content.arduino.cc/assets/Pinout-Micro_latest.png): D12

     * The physical label printed on the PCB: 12

     The existing `leonardo.rs` file almost perfectly matches the Micro's pinout
     diagram. Am I correct in assuming that I should therefore use `leonardo.rs`
     rather than creating an entirely separate `micro.rs` based off of the
     schematic's labels?
