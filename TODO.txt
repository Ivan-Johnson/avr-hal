# TODO

[ ] Pickup delivery (Leonardo & USB passthrough boards)

[ ] Find example of bigger features that were implemented by people other than Rahix.

    Is there anything I can learn from them? Obvious example: does Rahix have a
    preference for/against force pushes when updating CR?

[ ] Ensure that registers are initialized correctly on boot. i.e. replace many
    `.modify(...)`s with `write`s

[ ] Make code safer:

    * Some `unsafe` blocks are unnecessary? I can patch avr-device to mark those
      registers as safe?

    * Some `unsafe` blocks are necessary. To reduce risk, I should make a safe
      wrapper: Unsafe PAC -> safe wrapper -> usb.rs

# Final testing

Before updating PR, verify:

* Run `doc`, and read the docs:

  file:///home/i/Workspaces/2/avr-hal/target/doc/atmega_hal/struct.UsbdBus.html#limit-1

* publish the docs to my fork, and share a link so that Rahix can review
